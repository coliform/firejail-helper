# firejail-helper

This script automates the process of creating a fake home directory & creating a launcher shortcut for a binary. It also moves the binary somewhere else so that you don't accidentally run it outside Firejail.


## Requirements

Firejail (lol). On Debian or Ubuntu, run:

`apt install firejail firejail-profiles`
